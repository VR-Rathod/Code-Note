## 1. History
-
	- **How**: Unreal Engine was developed by Epic Games, with its first version released in 1998 for the game "Unreal."
	- **Who**: The engine was created by Tim Sweeney and his team at Epic Games.
	- **Why**: Unreal Engine was designed to provide a high-quality game development platform with advanced graphics, physics, and networking capabilities, catering to the needs of developers in the gaming industry.
-
- ## 2. Intro
-
	- Unreal Engine is a powerful game engine widely used for developing 3D games, simulations, and virtual reality experiences. Known for its high-fidelity graphics and robust toolset, Unreal Engine enables developers to create visually stunning environments and complex gameplay mechanics. Its Blueprint visual scripting system allows designers to implement functionality without deep programming knowledge, making it accessible to a broader range of users.
-
	- ### Advantages
		- High-quality graphics and real-time rendering capabilities.
		- Blueprint visual scripting for easy logic implementation.
		- Extensive community support and resources, including documentation and forums.
		- Strong integration with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) development.
-
	- ### Disadvantages
		- Steeper learning curve for beginners compared to some other engines.
		- Resource-intensive, requiring a powerful machine for optimal performance.
		- The complexity of features can overwhelm new users.
